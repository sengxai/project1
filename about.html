                    Hello!
                </p>

                <p>
                    My name is Gaohli and also go by the name of Gaoneng. I am the owner of Vintage Ideal Cards!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started doing this card business when I was in my senior year of highschool. How I started
                    getting into making cards was when I first entered in a custom Christmas card contest at
                    the Boys & Girls Club in Wausau. I entered in not knowing that my card would be chosen for
                    this contest. The reason why I do this now is because I love art, I love drawing, and learning creative
                    ideas. As I started drawing I've decided why not give the cards a try?
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is another part of why I am doing this is because, I wanted to incorporate my own culture
                    into my own cards. I wanted to express the messages behind the Hmong symbols and drawings. With a 
                    traditaional and modern day mix it I would feel more of an attachment to the products I make.
